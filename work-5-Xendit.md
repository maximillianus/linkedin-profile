# Xendit

## Data Scientist / Software Engineer
Overview:
Xendit is a fintech-based payment gateway startup from YC S15. Here we are trying to simplify payments and build a gold standard for digital infrastructure in Southeast Asia. 

I am working on a multifaceted role as a data scientist / software engineer. I analyse data on daily basis, develop machine learning models when needed, and wrap them in a microservice API product. This exposure allows me to have a bird-eye view of a data science project from problem formulation to model deployment. The extension of my job scope includes liaising with various internal and external customers, creating ETL pipelines, and data mentorship. In-between all those hustle and bustle, I love to squeeze in ping-pong and snooker.

- Design, develop, deploy ML-based Fraud Detection System.
- Develop and deploy various Flask-based microservices with messaging queue + relational database integration.
