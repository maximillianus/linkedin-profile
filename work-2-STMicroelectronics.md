## Process Engineer

Overview:
STMicroelectronics is French-Italian semiconductor multinational company. It is the largest semiconductor chip manufacturer in Europe.

My role here is as a Process Engineer. I am to ensure production process goes smoothly, to design and give solution whenever production issues happen, and to assist operators and technician in ensuring the best wafer quality.

Key Responsibilities:
• Supervised the quality of JETMOS 6" photolithography process in wafer fab line by ensuring equipment efficiency and precise resist pattern on wafer.
• Proposed and implemented engineering solution to factory issue by coordinating a team of operators and technicians to assist in the implementation.
• Executed the implementation of equipment replacement project to minimize process quality issues and maximize wafer production output. 
• Demonstrated excellent knowledge and expertise in operating photolithography equipments which include UltraTech stepper, Perkin Elmer aligner, KLA Tencor defect scanner, DNS coater-developer.

Key Achievements:
• Boosted production output and greatly reduced scrap risk by inspecting the quality of 50
accident lots of wafer in a single shift.
