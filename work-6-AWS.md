## Previous
AWS is the first and one of the biggest Cloud Service Provider. AWS has been serving their customers for 17 years and counting. With AWS, customers enjoy more than 200 Cloud services, global scalable infrastructure, and one of the most stringent security standard. As of 2021 Gartner survey, AWS continues to be trusted as Cloud Leader for 12th straight consecutive years.

I am working as a Solution Architect where I interact with external clients directly. I provide my clients with AWS services recommendation, guidance on getting started, consultation on technical matters, and exciting chat over the latest technology trend. I also speak in various public seminars, guest lectures, and conferences to demonstrate thought leadership about Cloud.

Being an earlier part of Public Sector team, I have the fortunate opportunity to grow AWS presence in Indonesia especially in Education, NPO, Government, State-owned Enterprises, and Healthcare sector. My interest towards Analytics and AI/ML leads me to specialize technically in these tech domains
